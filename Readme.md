# Scenario Testing

This is an experiment in creating a Gherkin style syntax for scenario testing within the confines of the C# language.

I tried to create a similar library some years ago, but the boilerplate overhead required by C# made the library unusable. Recent improvements to the C# language (mostly changes in the C# 7 series), have inspired me to try again and I think the result is at least somewhat usable.
